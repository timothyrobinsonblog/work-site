        Salt Of The Earth
      </section>

      <article class="text">
        The <em>Salt Of The Earth</em> series grew from a plaguing curiosity about what binds and separates us. I
        initially sought to document the myriad of ways that individuals go about their daily lives. I quickly realised
        the impossibility of such an epic task. I therefore resigned myself to simply observing and listening to the
        ones who were willing to share their time with me.
        <p></p>
        The result is a series of photographs and accompanying stories. Please know that whilst several stories are
        fiction, the large majority are factual. Many pieces could easily be extended into whole essays. However,
        studying a single subject in depth was never the aim. Rather, I wanted to create a snapshot of human life in a
        kaleidoscope form. Each bead of colour contrasting with the light or darkness of the next. I completed the
        series during December 2015, and it contains stories from the following countries: Pakistan, India, Laos,
        Morocco, Vietnam, Cambodia, USA, Australia, and England.
        <p></p>
        The phrase “salt of the earth” is from verse 5:13 of the <em>New Testament’s Gospel of Matthew</em>. In my
        humility, I’ve chosen to reject the traditional interpretation of the idiom, as decreed by the theologians. For
        me, the phrase refers to any person who holds some light or radiance within them. Any soul that fires and burns
        and rages and refuses to acquiesce to the gentle violence summoned by the dark quiet night. I’ll admit that the
        hardness of reality has tempered the utopian ideals that I once held. However, I still believe that every man
        and woman has a story to tell. No matter the grand or humble place that each is given in the great cosmic drama
        of human life. To hear this story, I just had to listen with patience and warmth. From suicide bombings and
        heroin addiction, to newlywed couples and ballerinas on stage. Some baptised by tragedy, others dancing in
        comedy. I found each encounter fascinating and rewarding. I hope you do too.

          I have bipolar disorder, which is a mood disorder that affects your emotions and thoughts. There's no cure, so
          now I'm trying to stabilise myself with medication. I was only properly diagnosed three years ago, but it has
          affected me for a long time. Much longer than three years. Bipolar has impacted every area of my life. Family,
          money, friends, lovers, work. I have a tattoo on my hip. Nine strikes with a coffin at the end. I've attempted
          suicide four times, so I have five lives left. Suicide seems the only option when I’m suffering a low. The one
          thing that saves me is my children. What keeps me alive is the thought of my kids looking over into my coffin.
          I don't want to put them through that pain. I miss my wife. She's my ex-wife now. I miss my children. They
          will always be my <em>what if</em>. I am not my mental illness, I just don't know how to control it so I can
          be me. The real me. I really am a good guy.

          I've wondered what I'm searching for in all this. It's not happiness or joy, it's something that I can't

          I like the sun but not too much. Just enough so it's warm without being hot. Clouds in the sky remind me of
          home. Tibet is home. I left as a refugee when I was a young girl. The journey took a month. We walked during
          the dark winter nights so the guards wouldn't see us and shoot. I crossed the border with a group of around
          twenty people. Men, women, children, both young and old. Two people died during the trek because of the
          starvation and exhaustion and cold. During winter, snow buries the mountains and the land becomes brutal. I
          planned and talked and wondered about the decision for years. When the day to leave finally came, I awoke
          knowing that I’d never see my family again. I haven't spoken to my parents in eight years, so I don't know if
          they're still alive. I now live in a small Tibetan community with my sister. When we sit down to eat together,
          memories of home come vividly into my mind. Then I wonder how everyone is doing. If you met me and talked to
          me, you’d probably think that I’m contented. The truth is that I'm anxious about the future. I believe in
          reincarnation. I believe that I'll come back to earth as another animal after I die. I'm afraid of this. I
          don't want to live again. One life is enough for me.

          I used to dance with a close friend whose name was Hailey. It was impossible to dislike her. Maybe some did
          out of jealousy. She was beautiful and gentle and confident and kind. The poor girl was also bulimic. Hailey
          had been hiding the illness for five years. We all had our suspicions, and she finally confessed soon before
          it happened. The argument lasted ten hours, but Hailey eventually admitted her bulimia to her parents. After
          this, Hailey promised to get healthy. She didn’t and two weeks later she died. Her heart stopped beating in
          her sleep because her body was lacking essential chemicals. After going through the death of my closest
          friend, I started to hate the industry and what it does to people. Especially the dancers. Many of my friends
          who danced had eating disorders. Quitting was difficult because I’d wanted to be a ballerina since I was three
          years old. I still love the feeling of freedom that comes with moving my body. One day I’ll visit the college
          where I trained and talk to the students. Ballet looks glamorous from the outside, and some of it is, but
          there's more to life than being a ballerina. I’ll tell them that.

          from the boy that I went with, and we married within several years. He was a Morse code operator during the
          war, World War II, and then stayed with the post office until retirement. After our three daughters moved away
          from home, we travelled to Europe and Japan. My grandson still has the engraved wooden chest that we brought
          home from Singapore. Arthur is sick now though. It started years ago, and he had surgery years ago, but his
          body has slowly deteriorated. I regularly visit him where he’s staying. I’d much rather look after him myself
          at home, but that just can’t happen. He appreciates it when others visit. I bought him a stuffed dog toy
          dressed in a yellow raincoat that plays <em>Singing In The Rain</em> by Gene Kelly. This made his life easier
          for a moment. He loved music until the end.

          I left home to join the monastery as a novice monk two years ago, and I haven't seen my family for nearly
          twelve months. It’s tradition in my country that young males join the sangha, the Buddhist monastic order, for
          a period of time. Some stay on as fully ordained monks, whilst others leave and resume life as a layperson. My
          days have a steady rhythm here. I’m up at four in the morning every day, in bed with lights out by nine. There
          are morning prayers, daily meditation, and I also take part in alms. However, a lot of my time is spent at
          school or in study. At the monastery, I share a room with two friends who are also novices. There are two
          pictures on the wall above my bed. I have a poster of my favourite band, and a photograph of an elderly monk
          who I admire. Eventually I'd like to leave the monastery and study to be a lawyer.

          I find it difficult to show anyone my lyrics or songs. It’s not stage fright, it's just that I'm scared of
          what the audience may think. I'm scared because when I write a song, I feel like I'm being completely honest
          and showing the world who I really am inside. As if I’m stripping bare on a stage and telling people all my
          secrets. I write at a cafe that’s seven blocks away from my house. I walk there. Each time, I'm secretly
          hoping that I don't see anybody I know because I'm quite happy in my own world.

          music. I lived amongst stories and the characters became my friends. I've since moved to the city. It’s
          different here. In my hometown, the morning light bounces off the trees and covers everything with a faint
          golden tinge. Light made of purple mixed with red bathes the open fields come evening. I now live in a port
          city, hardly a metropolis, but even the stars are blocked out at night. I don’t know what to make of that. I
          still escape to the comfort of my imagination sometimes, but I’m surrounded by caring and gentle souls here.

          I watched the needle go through my flesh and pierce the vein. Red blood filled the glass barrel of the syringe
          as I injected the liquid. Then the heroin rushed through my body. Everything in my mind drifted away. The
          anger, fear, impatience, anxiety, pain. All disappeared as I was bathed in a pure sense of serene calmness and
          tranquility. That didn't last long. I started shooting heroin during high school when I was sixteen. At first,
          I just joined in with my friends. It quickly became an escape from the stress in my life. I didn't achieve
          anything exceptional and I often considered myself a failure. Now I want to be clean, but it’s not easy. A
          close friend once relapsed and overdosed. He was a veteran junky. Young though. Twenty-seven when he died. I
          wanted to be a mechanic when I was a boy, and I was working towards this goal with my father. A man whom I
          love and respect. Dad gave me a job in his business. I could help because I'm good at understanding how
          machines work. I like figuring out how the parts interact and then fixing the problem. I get afraid that I’ll
          be an addict forever, no matter what, and my life will be a constant struggle. Suicide has entered my mind. I
          do exercise when I have cravings. Running mainly, sometimes football. It helps.

          any tree, wrap my arms around, and put my ear to the trunk. For me, this is to experience my childhood again.
          The rough bark, curve of their branches, and smell of the leaves covered by fresh rain. The local trees were

            <em>
              Munch munch munch, going to Kings to get a king-size lunch
            </em>
          </p>
          Every time, the same words. He thought it was hilarious. I still think of him as dad, and I still call him dad
          when he comes up in conversation. On his birthday, I visit his grave and sit there with tea and cakes and
          family. He’s gone for a wander elsewhere, but I know that he’ll never really leave. He’s dad for always.

          The most terrifying thing for me is not knowing where I belong in this world. I've looked long and hard at
          myself, I've gone well beyond the surface, and I still can't find what I'm looking for. Growing up, I was
          surrounded by incredibly talented and smart people. I sometimes feel like a complete failure in comparison.
          Maybe expectations are the problem though, and it’s just naïve to wish for my own calling or destiny or fate.
          I put so much pressure on myself, but perhaps I’ll never find one thing I can commit my life to. The marrow of
          our lives found not in the realisation of grand visions, but in minor details and interactions that rush by
          unnoticed and unannounced with the passing of each day. It's partly just a desire to be accepted and loved.
          For who I am, not for who I could be.

          My obsession with books comes from my grandfather. He had a study, and in that study were four walls, and
          three of those four walls were covered in all manner of books. All organised alphabetically. His dirty little
          secret was reading and rereading the novels of Jane Austen. I think that library was why he could never take
          anything too seriously. For him, everything and everyone was just a part of one great stage play.

          I used to be homeless. I've got a scar near my rib cage from when I was stabbed several years ago. I was
          sleeping in the park, and a group of strangers approached me during the night. Things are different now
          though. I've recently met a girl too. I like her a lot.

          I had a strict upbringing with little personal choice or freedom. Curfews were the norm in my family home. My
          parents gave me a strong sense of right and wrong, but they smothered me and were overprotective. This just
          makes me want to run away. Not love them as a daughter should. I want to be honest with my parents. I want to
          say how I feel without being judged or mocked. I can’t though. They just don't realise or accept that I'm
          different to them. These days, I get attached too easily. I’m sure that’s an outcome of my upbringing, and I
          would change this personality trait if I could. Sometimes I don't want to be attached. I crave the freedom and
          independence that I didn't have growing up. I say this, but the world is cold and lonely if I explore it
          alone, so it’s often frightening to say goodbye to people. I have a Mickey Mouse doll that I still sleep with
          at night. It's as big as my arm. It's embarrassing that I still have it, but it keeps me company when nobody
          else will. We all need some love.

          It was a Sunday morning treat. Mum took me out with nanna. We went to the same café and sat at the same table
          every Sunday. They ordered coffee and I took mocha. Hot chocolate is too sweet. When the drinks came, I
          scooped the foam off the cappuccinos and ate all four pieces of shortbread. Grandma gave me her biscuits, but
          I had to steal them from mum. She’d never eat them! So I always did!

          I was out with friends one night and we separated. I went off alone, met trouble somehow, and was attacked by
          a group on the street. I collapsed to the ground after becoming unconscious and awoke alone in an alleyway.
          Eyes black with bruise and face painted with blood. It happened several years ago, but the fear is still in my
          mind. I just can't forget about it. I rarely go out with my friends at night anymore. Not like I did. The rare
          time that I do, I’m just anxious and nervous. Then memories of that night, memories of having physical harm
          inflicted upon me for no reason, come flooding back. Not a fate I would wish upon anyone. My experiences have
          made me want to help others who have suffered from mental health difficulties. Soon after this experience, I
          entered university to study nursing so I can work in mental health. I might become a counsellor one day. I
          also have a black belt now. Those cowards won’t ever get me again.
