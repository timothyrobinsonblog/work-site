        Here are four tech projects that I’ve worked on over the past several years: a land-suitability modelling project using GIS technology, an online hub for a start-up, a personal creative site, and a design / development practice that I co-founded.

            <div class="essay-summary">
              This project uses ArcGIS Pro to identify suitable locations for a solar-passive residential development in the Batlow region near Canberra. I built raster-based models for building suitability, agriculture, forestry, conservation, and Indigenous heritage, and then integrated them within a multi-objective land allocation framework. Fire and flood hazard constraints were applied to ensure development safety. Given Batlow’s local economy, the analysis incorporated land with agricultural or forestry potential alongside areas of ecological or cultural significance. Both fuzzy and Boolean logic, together with a variety of datasets, were used to support spatial decision-making. The final outputs optimise solar exposure, minimise hazard risk, and preserve ecological and cultural values. This work demonstrates how spatial modelling can guide land-use planning by balancing competing environmental and economic objectives.

              I co-founded Atomic Vision to offer personalised yet affordable web design and development services tailored to small businesses competing in a crowded marketplace. I’ve designed and developed a suite of pre-configured, modular websites from scratch primarily using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Adobe Creative Suite. Built with reusable code modules and pluggable features to enable rapid deployment. I also conducted target market research and developed business strategy. Launch is imminent.

              Plastic Words was a corporate communications start-up based in Perth, Australia. I collaborated with the team on client communications, product development, and brand strategy. I also led the design, development, and maintenance of the company’s main website, built to showcase our brand to prospective clients. I created this responsive website with dark/light modes and a corporate-minimalist aesthetic. I also produced infographics, business cards, Google Meet backgrounds, and developed an interactive word game for potential marketing content. I worked independently and remotely with a high degree of autonomy on all projects.

              Remember building in Dreamweaver using a dial-up modem? Years after that first brush with development, I finally learnt to code during the pandemic. This site was my first real project after a crash course in the basics. I built it to showcase my creative work, primarily photography, and front-end development skills. At the time, it felt like such a steep learning curve, and there was no AI to lean on. Just Stack Exchange, tutorials, and the docs. My persistence paid off though, and I’m still proud of how it turned out. It remains a strong reflection of some early lessons in tech, and the photography that I did during my extensive travels.
